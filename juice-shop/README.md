# OWASP Juice Shop

[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

I ported it over as Home Assistant Addon as a fun project. Just in case you want to do the juice shop on your Home Assistant OS.
