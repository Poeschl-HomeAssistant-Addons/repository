# OWASP ZAP Home Assistant Addon

# üï∏Ô∏è Depreciated

The world's most popular free web security tool, now as Home Assistant addon.
I personally use it to occasionally check data of IoT devices.

## Configuration

At the moment there is none on the addon itself. Settings can be adjusted over the ui of ZAP itself.

### Raspberry Pi

ZAP's startup is very slow on a Raspberry Pi 4. You have been warned.
